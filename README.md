Some UI fixes and enhancements for Journey of the Prairie King. Some fixes are only for things noticeable after beating the game a few times.

Works with Generic Mod Config Menu. 

Adds the following:

    Death counter (shown below coin count)
    Item durations remaining (shown at the bottom of the game)
    Win/Round counter (shown in the top right after beating the game once)
    Colored level indicators (replaces the original indicators to match the theme of the levels that were beat)
    Final boss max HP scales with the number of times the game has been beaten


Fixes the following:

    Level indicators overflowing off the bottom of the screen (after beating the game multiple times)
    Coin and Lives counters getting cut off after having more than 100 or 1000. This fix moves that part of the UI to the left a little bit, and also shortens the counter if it's a lot (e.g. 4,356 coins would show 4.3k instead)
    Background above and below map, when transitioning levels, is pure black, instead of the almost-black color the rest of the background is
    Final boss HP bar overflowing to the right of the screen (after beating the game once)


Everything is configurable, so you can disable certain parts if you want. It also supports the Generic Mod Config Menu, so you can modify the config in-game.

Deaths are not counted by the game by default, so any in-progress game will not be accurate to start, but any deaths after loading the mod will be counted.
